# The VSCode Rant

_You got your browser in my text editor! :(_

The first text editor I ever used to write any kind of software at all was Notepad. I think most of us have had a similar experience, especially when we first start out. For me, I was ten years old, bright eyed, bushy tailed, and I had just been suddenly and irreversibly struck by what would soon become my life's ultimate passion. But, first, I had to see if it was really true; if all it took to bend a computer (something my ten year old brain had imagined took decades upon decades of practice to do well) to my will was a few lines of text.

It was a movie that sparked my young brain a churning, that movie being The Social Network (MUST SEE). My mother had taken me to see it in theaters, I had practically begged her to take me after I had watched the trailers for it,  I was hooked before we even sat down in our seats. After it was done, my life had changed forever, my brain would not stop thinking about computers and programming, creating the next big Social Networking website (for teens, no less), and becoming rich beyond my wildest dreams. Okay, so maybe my ten year old motivations for wanting to be a software engineer weren't quite so pure. But it was still enough to entice me to literally run to the family computer the moment I burst through the door. As fast as my little fingers could fly, I Googled something along the lines of "Programming for kids" or "First program" or something a ten year old would come up with. To make a long story short, the first line of code I ever wrote, technically speaking, was a single line Batch file that echoed the string 'My First Program'. I wrote it in Notepad. The rest, as they say, is history...

Except now I'm professionally employed and work full time in VSCode... **_fuck._**

## VSCode - The Good, The Bad, And The 90% Memory Usage?!?

I want to clarify something really quick here before we move on with my rant. It's important for me to say this now, before I start bashing VSCode (and thus drawing the VSCode Fanbois), and that's that I absolutely **_ADORE_** Visual Studio Code as a text editor for just about anything you need to edit... On Windows that is. Linux is another story, but we can get to that later. If you're on Windows and you need a text editor or IDE for just about any modern programming language under the sun, VSCode not only has you covered, but most likely has either First Class support for your language, or a dedicated community that supports your language in VSCode. So yeah, don't go off on me like I'm saying I hate VSCode and everything it stands for. That couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the only reason I'm writing this post at all is because I work inside VSCode for 8++ hours a day most days a week. It's a rant of love... and annoyance.

My first foray into the wide world of VSC was when I was about 16-17 years old. I had been using everything from Sublime to Atom to straight VS at the time, finding them all serviceable depending on what kind of Project I had in mind. Obviously Atom and Sublime are much more generic than VS, so I'd use those two pretty interchangeably when working on projects that don't directly require Visual Studio in order to build. Eventually I began using Atom more often, almost leaving sublime behind in favor of the other annoying web based text editor.
